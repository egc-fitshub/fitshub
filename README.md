# fitshub<span>.io</span>

**fitshub<span>.io</span>** is a collaborative platform and repository of FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) models designed for astronomical databases.  
FITS is the standard format for storing, transmitting, and processing astronomical data, supporting multi-dimensional arrays and rich metadata such as photometric, spatial, and calibration information.

fitshub<span>.io</span> is a **fork of [uvlhub.io](https://uvlhub.io/)**, enhancing the original platform with new FITS models and additional functionality.  
The platform integrates a **Zenodo clone** for dataset management and the **AstroPy** library for data handling and analysis, promoting interoperability and reproducibility in astronomical research.  
By following **Open Science** principles, fitshub<span>.io</span> aims to provide a structured and accessible environment for sharing scientific data and models within the astronomy community.

This project is developed by the **FitsHub Project Teams 1 and 2** as the practical component of the **Evolución y Gestión de la Configuración (EGC)** course at the **University of Seville**.
